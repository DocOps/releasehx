      Established an instance of ReleaseHx for managing the release history of... ReleaseHx
    note: |
      The ReleaseHx website now hosts a rich-text roster of change reports built with ReleaseHx itself at https://releasehx.docopslab.org/docs/releases/. The output is configured in `.config/releasehx.yml`, and the process is documented in `README.adoc`.

    summ: |
      The documented regexp format (/pattern/flags) is unsupported
    note: |
      Regular expressions in YAML files such as the releasehx application config now support being written as fully qualified strings with the pattern fenced in `/` markers. Use `/pattern/flags` formats such as the following and expect proper parsing.
      
      ```yaml
        note_pattern: /^((#+ Draft  Release Note.*?)\n+(?<note>(.|)+)/gmi
      ```

    parts:

    summ: |
      Config property mismatch: code reads `note_source` but docs specify `note`
    note: |
      Added support for a proper configuration property for release-note extraction, bringing the product into line with the documented config.
      The effective property was never documented, so it has been removed, but no deprecation was deemed necessary.
      Backward compatibility has been sacrificed in this rare case, since the functionality was obscured.

    part: templates
    summ: |
      Formatting errors in AsciiDoc templates
    note: |
      AsciiDoc templates have been cleaned up and streamlined significantly, mostly by removing the clumsy metadata that was hard to style in rich-text output. We will improve on these templates later and welcome contributions cleaning them up.
