          This probably matters less than you might imagine, as ReleaseHx will use AsciiDoc-style `+++_italic_+++` and `+++*bold*+++` syntax, and there should not be much call for divergent syntax like for links or images.

        docs: |
          The `jira`, `github`, and `gitlab` types are all REST APIs that return an individualized JSON payload upon request, to be converted to RHYML format.

          Alternately, you may use a file directly written in <<rhyml,RHYML-style YAML>> (`rhyml`).

          If you wish to mix Git and API sources, this field should still reference the API.

          Custom APIs are also available, but you will need to create a custom client in the `_apis` directory (<<conf_ppty_paths_api_clients_dir>>), and a custom mapping in the `_mappings` directory (<<conf_ppty_paths_mappings_dir).
      project:

        desc: |
          The local or remote URI for the API or JSON file.
          Either the REST API endpoint path or the path to a local or remote JSON file containing the issues data.

          This field may be templated, accepting Liquid placeholders like `{{ proj }}` (the sibling `project` property) or `{{ version }}` (the argued release version code).

            type: String
            desc: |
              The header to use for authentication.
              Only used if `origin.auth.mode` is `header`.
          cred_uri:
            type: URI
            desc: |
              The location of the API credentials file for declaring API authentication arguments without environment variables.

              The value can be a local path with read access or an HTTP path (not recommended unless ReleaseHx is always executed on an organizational VPN).
            docs: |
              The default order of credential strings defaults to:

              USERNAME
              ORGANIZATION
              ....

              However, this format can be customized using <<conf_ppty_cred_key_line>>, <<conf_ppty_cred_user_line>>, and <<conf_ppty_cred_org_line>>.

              Note that each of these lines can be overridden with an environment variable: <<conf_ppty_origin_auth_key_env>>, <<conf_ppty_origin_auth_user_env>>, and <<conf_ppty_origin_auth_org_env>>.

          The source of the summary (Changelog) content.
          Must be `issue_heading`, `custom_field`, or `commit_message_heading`.

          If `issue_heading`, the summary or title field will be used.
          If `commit_message_heading`, the first line of the Git commit will be used.
        dflt: issue
      head:
        type: String
        desc: |
          The source of release-note headlines, when it is not the same as the summary.

          Unless a `head` is available in the RHYML source, the `summ` will be used.
          By default, ReleaseHx does not generate a `head` property for work items.

          Potential values: `issue_heading`, `release_note_heading`, or `commit_message_heading`.
        docs: |
          When set to *`issue_heading`*, the RHYML `head` property will derive from the issue title or summary.

          When set to *`release_note_heading`* or *`commit_message_heading`*, the `head` property will derive from the first line of the release note or commit message, respectively, so long as it matches the Regular Expression set in `ppty.release_note_heading_pattern`.
          When set to `commit_message_heading`, the RHYML `head` property will derive from the first line of the commit message.
      note:

        desc: |
          The source of the release notes content.
          Must be `issue_body`, `custom_field`, or `commit_message`.

      note_custom_field:
        type: String
        desc: |

          Only used if `conversions.note` is `custom_field`.

          This purposely has no default, as you will probably have to look up the actual field ID, which will be something like `customfield_10010`.
      note_pattern:
        type: RegExp
        desc: |
          The Regular Expressions pattern to match in the body of an issue or commit message, after which all content is considered the release `note` matter.

          Defaults to a Markdown or AsciiDoc header or HTML comment with the case-insensitive string `release note` in it.

          Uses Capture group `note` in the Regular Expression to establish the entire note content.

          See the `conversions.head_pattern` property for details on extracting a heading (`head` in RHYML) from the `note` content.

          The Regular Expressions pattern to match in the `note` text to be used to establish a heading for the note (`head`).
          This text is removed from the `note` value during a draft operation, if the pattern matches.

          Defaults to a Markdown or AsciiDoc header or HTML comment with the case-insensitive string `release note` in it.

          The `head` capture group is snipped from text matching this pattern.

              `kramdown`:: Kramdown Markdown converter (for Markdown sources)
              `pandoc`:: Universal document converter (if available)
              
              When not specified, intelligent defaults apply:
              
              - AsciiDoc → HTML: `asciidoctor-html5s` (semantic HTML5)
              - Markdown → HTML: `kramdown`
              - RHYML → HTML: Liquid templates (no engine needed)
            docs: |
              The html5s backend produces cleaner, more semantic HTML with `<section>` elements
              instead of nested `<div class="sect1"><div class="sectionbody">` structures.
              
              This is particularly useful when you want to apply custom CSS or when generating
              HTML that will be further processed or embedded in other systems.
              
              For backwards compatibility or when you need the traditional Asciidoctor structure,
              use `asciidoctor-html5`.

          The prefix used in issue labels to identify type labels.
          For example, 'type:' would match labels like 'type:feature', 'type:bug'.
          Another common pattern is 'kind:' for labels like 'kind:feature', 'kind:enhancement'.

          If set to an empty string or null, type detection will only look for direct label matches
          against the configured type slugs (e.g., looking for 'bug', 'feature' labels directly).
        dflt: ''
        docs: |
          This setting allows you to customize how your organization names type labels.
          The mapping system will look for labels that start with this prefix to determine the type of each change.

          Examples:

          * `type:` matches `type:feature`, `type:bug`
          * `kind:` matches `kind:enhancement`, `kind:defect` 
          * `category-` matches `category-feature`, `category-bugfix`

  tags:
    type: Array
    desc: |
      Handling for tags, labels, or toggles associated with source Issues.

      Subordinate property keys (other than `include` and `exclude`) represent individual tag names, with the default set documented here.
      The property `<your_tag_name>` represents arbitrarily named tags, any number of which you are welcome to add.

      This block serves to filter out any unrelated labels/tags ingested from APIs during the conversion from payload to RHYML draft.
      Only tags with their own property here will be ported from the issue source to the RHYML change record's `tags` Array.
    properties:
      _include:
        type: Array
        desc: |
          The tags, labels, or toggles that trigger inclusion in the release history.

      _exclude:
        type: Array
        desc: |

        dflt: []
      highlight:
        desc:

               The literal string used in the Issues system for tagging or labeling an issue to be handled, if different than the key name.

               [NOTE]
               This technically does not have to be a "`Slug`" String, if the system permits spaces.
               It just needs to exactly match whatever String the remote API returns to represent the label/tag.

          The sort order for the changelog output.
        docs: &sort_docs_property |
          Indicate whether you wish to _group_ output by this sort criterion, or else just order by that criteria, with or without a label denoting the criterion.

          If `<criterion>:group` (default), the output will be grouped into sections with the group instance 
          If `<criterion>:grouping1`, the criterion will be added to the first of 2 grouping tiers into which the output will be divided.
          If `<criterion>:grouping2`, the criterion will be added to the second of 2 grouping tiers into which the output will be divided.
          If `<criterion>:label`, the output will be order by the criterion, with a label indicating the criterion.
          If `<criterion>:none`, the output will be ordered by the criterion, with no label.

          For example:

          [source,yaml]
          ----
          sort:
            - 'part:group'
            - 'type:label'
          ----

          Would produce something like:

          [source,markdown]
          ----
          ## Web UI

          - Feature description or summary [New feature]

          - Another feature description or summary [New feature]

          - Improvement description or summary [Improvement]

          ## Backend

          - Feature description or summary [New feature]

          - Bug fix description or summary [Bug Fixes]
          ----

          For 2-tiered grouping arrangements, use something like:

          [source,yaml]
          ----
          sort:
            - 'part:grouping1'
            - 'type:grouping2'
          ----

          This would output for instance:

          [source,markdown]
          ----
          ## Web UI

          ### New features
          - Feature description or summary
          - Another feature description or summary

          ### Improvements
          - Improvement description or summary
          ----

          You may also use tag-based groupings, but the tags must be listed explicitly.

          [source,yaml]
          ----
          sort:
            - 'breaking:group'
            - 'deprecation:group'
            - 'type:group'
            - 'part:label'
          ----

          This would output something akin to:

          [source,markdown]
          ----
          ## Breaking Changes
          - We are breaking this thing! [Web UI]

          ## Deprecations
          - We are deprecating this thing! [Backend]

          ## New features
          - Feature description or summary [Web UI]
          - Another feature description or summary [Web UI]

          ## Improvements
          - Improvement description or summary [Backend]
