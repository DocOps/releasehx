Do not use parentheses in Ruby block def (and class def) lines, but do use parentheses in method calls.

Use AsciiDoc for ALL documentation, including in YAML block strings, but not in Ruby code comments.

Use the style guide at <aylstack>/content/topics/asciidoc-authoring.adoc to direct your authoring style and syntax for AsciiDoc files. Use <aylstack>/content/topics/asciidoc-syntax.adoc as well, which is where the includes in the authoring file are sourced.
